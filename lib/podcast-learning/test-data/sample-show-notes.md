# Episode 1: Design Systems and Burnout with Sara Wachter-Boettcher

To round off the series, I'm speaking to coach, speaker and author of Technically Wrong and Design for Real Life, Sara Wachter-Boettcher.

Sara and I talk about why those of us working on design systems are so vulnerable to burnout and what we can do to prevent it. We talk about the importance of living your values, advocating for what's right, and - crucially - knowing when to quit.

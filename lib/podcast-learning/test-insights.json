  "Design systems teams are particularly vulnerable to burnout because they constantly context-switch between different teams and projects while doing infrastructure work that's often invisible and undervalued by organizations.",
  "Living your values in practice means being explicit about what matters to you and making decisions that align with those values, even when it puts you in conflict with organizational pressures to move fast and cut corners.",
  "Knowing when to quit is a strength, not a weakness - recognizing when you've advocated, tried, and done the work but the environment isn't changing is crucial for protecting your own sustainability.",
  "Making invisible work visible by documenting what you're doing, tracking your impact, and showing the value helps both others understand your contribution and helps you see what you've actually accomplished.",
  "Design systems practitioners who care deeply about accessibility, consistency, and craft face vulnerability when their values conflict with organizational structures that don't prioritize these aspects.",
  "Establishing clear boundaries about when you work and when you don't is essential because design systems work can feel endless with always more teams to support and components to build.",
  "Finding supportive communities - whether other design systems practitioners, people in your organization who understand, or online communities - is essential for validation when dealing with unreasonable situations.",
  "The emotional labor of convincing people why consistency and accessibility matter, combined with negotiating priorities and fighting for resources, contributes significantly to design systems team burnout."

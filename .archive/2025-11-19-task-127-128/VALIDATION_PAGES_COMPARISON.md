## Target Audience Profiles

### V1: Professional Founders
**Mindset**: "I know what I need. Show me the options."
- Time-constrained
- Decision-ready
- Prefers clarity over persuasion
- Responds to features/benefits
- Low tolerance for fluff

**When They Convert**:
- After reviewing packages
- When benefits align with needs
- After seeing examples
- Quick decision cycle (1 visit)

---

### V2: Pain-Aware Founders
**Mindset**: "I've been burned before. Prove this works."
- Previous failed launches
- Data-driven decision maker
- Skeptical of "pretty" solutions
- Responds to problem framing
- Needs proof upfront

**When They Convert**:
- After seeing stats/proof
- When pain points resonate
- After reviewing examples
- Quick-to-medium cycle (1-2 visits)

---

### V3: Trust-Seeking Founders
**Mindset**: "Who are you? Why should I trust you?"
- First-time founders or risk-averse
- Needs comprehensive information
- Values authenticity/transparency
- Responds to personal story
- Needs multiple touchpoints

**When They Convert**:
- After reading full story
- When credentials resonate
- After downloading checklist (lead nurture)
- Medium-to-long cycle (2-4 visits)

---

## A/B Test Hypothesis

### Primary Hypothesis
**V3 will win** because trust + comprehensive information = higher conversion for validation services (high-consideration purchase).

**Why**:
- Validation services require trust (you're asking founders to change their process)
- High ticket price (£497-£997) needs justification
- Authentic "Why I Built This" reduces skepticism
- FAQ removes objections
- Lead magnet enables lead nurture for slower converters

**Expected Conversion**: 8-12%

---

### Alternative Hypothesis (Dark Horse)
**V2 could surprise** if founders are pain-aware and prefer direct, problem-focused messaging.

**Why**:
- Problem framing creates urgency
- Stats upfront establish credibility immediately
- Less friction than V3 (no 7-screen scroll)
- Aggressive tone matches founder mindset ("I need to ship fast")

**Expected Conversion**: 6-10%

---

### Baseline Hypothesis
**V1 will underperform** because it lacks both the urgency of V2 and the trust of V3.

**Why**:
- Too generic ("validation-first landing pages" = unclear value prop)
- No emotional hook (neither problem nor story)
- Minimal differentiation from competition

**Expected Conversion**: 3-6%

  A) Immediate conversion: 10% (0.3)
  B) Lead nurture via email: 90% (0.9)
     ↓ 30% convert later (0.3)
     
= 0.6% immediate + 0.3% nurture = 0.9% total
OR
= Higher immediate if "Why I Built This" resonates (2-3%)
```

**Key Insight**: V3 has lowest immediate conversion but highest long-term conversion via lead nurture.

## Test Design

### Traffic Split
- **50%** → V3 (Comprehensive - baseline)
- **25%** → V1 (Simplified Professional - test)
- **25%** → V2 (Simplified Problem-Focused - test)

**Rationale**: V3 most closely matches current live site, so keep as majority to avoid revenue risk.

### Test Duration
- **Minimum**: 2 weeks
- **Minimum Sample**: 500 total visitors (250 V3, 125 V1, 125 V2)
- **Confidence**: 95%

### Success Metrics

**Primary**:
1. Package purchase click-through rate (CTR)
   - Click "Choose Core/Premium" button
   - Track which variant drove click

**Secondary**:
2. Time on page (engagement)
3. Scroll depth (content consumption)
4. Example page views (interest in proof)

**Tertiary** (V3 only):
5. Checklist download rate (lead capture)
6. Email open rate (nurture effectiveness)

### Plausible Events to Track

```javascript
// Package clicks (all variants)
plausible('Package_Click', { 
  props: { 
    package: 'Core|Premium|Addon', 
    variant: 'V1|V2|V3',
    location: 'top|bottom' // which CTA
  }
})

// Example views (all variants)
plausible('Example_View', { 
  props: { 
    example: 'Starter|Standard|Compare', 
    variant: 'V1|V2|V3' 
  }
})

// Scroll depth (all variants)
plausible('Scroll_Depth', { 
  props: { 
    depth: '25|50|75|100', 
    variant: 'V1|V2|V3' 
  }
})

// Checklist download (V3 only)
plausible('Checklist_Download', { 
  props: { 
    variant: 'V3' 
  }
})
```

## Expected Results

### Scenario 1: V3 Wins (70% probability)
**Data**: V3 = 8-12% | V2 = 6-10% | V1 = 3-6%

**Insight**: Comprehensive content + authentic story builds trust

**Action**:
- Keep V3 as primary
- Archive V1 and V2
- Optimize V3 based on heatmaps (cut low-engagement sections)

---

### Scenario 2: V2 Wins (20% probability)
**Data**: V2 = 8-12% | V3 = 6-10% | V1 = 3-6%

**Insight**: Problem-focused messaging converts pain-aware founders faster

**Action**:
- Adopt V2 structure
- Add "Why I Built This" story from V3 after packages
- Keep examples section
- Result: Hybrid V2+V3 (problem framing + authentic story)

---

### Scenario 3: V1 Wins (5% probability)
**Data**: V1 = 8-12% | V3 = 6-10% | V2 = 4-8%

**Insight**: Professional tone + simplicity preferred (surprising!)

**Action**:
- Adopt V1 structure
- Add authentic story section from V3
- Consider adding FAQ
- Result: Simplified V1 with trust elements

---

### Scenario 4: All Similar (5% probability)
**Data**: All within 1-2% of each other

**Insight**: Structure matters less than examples section

**Action**:
- Keep V3 (most complete)
- A/B test examples placement next:
  - After packages (current)
  - Before packages (hero area)
  - Inline in package cards

---

## Mobile Considerations

### V1: Mobile-Friendly ✅
- **Pros**: Short page, fast load, easy to scan
- **Cons**: May feel too minimal (lack of trust signals)

### V2: Mobile-Optimized ✅
- **Pros**: Strong hero, stats upfront, medium length
- **Cons**: Problem framing may feel aggressive on small screen

### V3: Mobile-Challenging ⚠️
- **Pros**: Comprehensive, authentic story, lead magnet
- **Cons**: Long scroll (7 screens), high cognitive load, risk of dropoff

**Mobile Hypothesis**: V1 or V2 likely wins on mobile, V3 wins on desktop.

**Test Split by Device**:
- Track conversions separately for mobile vs desktop
- May need device-specific recommendations

## Next Steps (Task 128)

1. **Implement Variant Assignment Logic**
   - URL parameter: `?variant=v1/v2/v3`
   - localStorage persistence
   - Random assignment (50/25/25 split)

2. **Set Up Plausible Custom Events**
   - Package click tracking
   - Example view tracking
   - Scroll depth tracking
   - Checklist download (V3)

3. **Create Reporting Dashboard**
   - Real-time conversion rates by variant
   - Time on page by variant
   - Scroll depth heatmaps
   - Example page views

4. **Deploy & Monitor**
   - Run test for 2 weeks
   - Analyze results
   - Pick winner or create hybrid

## Alignment with Original Plan

### ✅ Matches Plan
- **ExamplesSection integration**: After packages ✓
- **GreenRoot examples**: Starter + Standard ✓
- **Screenshots**: Full-page captures ✓
- **Conversion data**: 6.8% and 11.2% ✓
- **A/B test showcase**: Standard page has interactive modal ✓

### ✨ Exceeds Plan
- **3 complete validation page structures** (not just example placement variants)
- **Authentic "Why I Built This"** (replaced fake testimonials)
- **Strategic A/B test** (structure effectiveness vs placement)
- **Comprehensive documentation** (this file + TASK_127_COMPLETE_V1_V2_V3_READY.md)

### 🎯 Strategic Decision
**Option 2** provides more actionable insights:
- Which messaging approach works best?
- How much content is too much?
- Does authenticity drive conversion?

Result: Better understanding of what founders need to see before purchasing validation services.

---

**Status**: ✅ Ready for A/B Testing  
**Build Time**: ~30 hours (exceeded original 23-29 hour estimate due to V3 comprehensive structure)  
**ROI**: Expected 20-35% conversion lift from winner vs. current baseline  
**Confidence**: High (three distinct approaches cover major founder personas)

			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Audit and Document Landing Page Sections",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the audit process into: (1) Reviewing and listing all visible landing page sections, (2) Documenting each section's name, description, and visual elements, (3) Validating completeness and accuracy with stakeholders or designers.",
			"reasoning": "This task is primarily analytical and documentation-focused, requiring careful review of the landing page and structured recording of information. While it involves stakeholder validation and attention to detail, it does not require complex technical implementation or deep integration. The main challenges are completeness, accuracy, and clear communication with stakeholders, which are manageable with standard best practices for audits and documentation[1][2][3]."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Install and Configure shadcn/ui Icon Library",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the setup into: (1) Installing shadcn/ui or Lucide React icons, (2) Configuring Tailwind CSS (if needed), (3) Creating a central icons export file, (4) Verifying accessibility and theme support in a sample component.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves dependency management, configuration, and initial integration with the project's tech stack. Ensuring accessibility and theme compatibility adds moderate complexity, especially if Tailwind or dark/light mode support is not already present. Testing and verifying accessibility are essential, but the process follows established patterns and documentation from shadcn/ui and Lucide, keeping complexity moderate."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Create Reusable Icon Component System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Designing the Icon component API, (2) Implementing support for multiple icon libraries (Lucide, Radix), (3) Adding sizing, accessibility, and theme support, (4) Integrating Tailwind CSS for styling, (5) Writing usage documentation and tests.",
			"reasoning": "Developing a reusable component system requires thoughtful API design, handling multiple icon libraries, and ensuring accessibility and theme support. Testing for compliance and documenting usage are also necessary. The need for flexibility, maintainability, and adherence to accessibility standards increases the technical challenge, making this task moderately complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Icon Selection and Mapping for Each Section",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subdivide into: (1) Reviewing documented sections and their purposes, (2) Selecting and assigning appropriate icons for each section, (3) Documenting the icon mapping and reviewing with stakeholders.",
			"reasoning": "This task is primarily about design decision-making and documentation, with some stakeholder collaboration. The technical aspect is minimal, but ensuring visual consistency and stakeholder alignment requires careful attention. The process is straightforward but benefits from structured review and feedback cycles."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Icons and Styling on Landing Page",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Updating section components to include icons, (2) Applying Tailwind CSS for styling and responsiveness, (3) Adding accessibility features and transitions, (4) Testing across browsers and devices.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves updating multiple UI components, ensuring consistent styling, accessibility, and responsiveness. Cross-browser/device testing and accessibility audits add to the implementation and QA effort. While the patterns are standard, the breadth of updates and need for thorough testing increase complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Documentation and Future Icon Addition Guide",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: (1) Documenting the current icon system and mapping, (2) Writing clear instructions for adding new icons (including CLI commands and accessibility), (3) Validating documentation usability with a developer and updating as needed.",
			"reasoning": "This is a documentation-heavy task with a focus on clarity, completeness, and accessibility for both developers and designers. The main challenge is ensuring the guide is actionable and easy to follow, which can be validated through user testing. The technical complexity is low, but attention to detail and iterative feedback are important."

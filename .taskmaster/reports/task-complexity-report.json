			"taskTitle": "Implement Project Context Detection and Validation System",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the Project Context Detection and Validation System into subtasks covering: project registry design, alias and metadata support, fuzzy matching logic, directory traversal, validation functions, user interaction workflows, integration with agent tools, safeguard mechanisms, audit logging, template updates, and comprehensive testing (unit, integration, scenario, edge cases, user acceptance).",
			"reasoning": "This task involves designing and implementing a multi-layered system that must reliably detect, validate, and manage project context across a variety of scenarios. The requirements span several technical domains: file system operations, fuzzy string matching, configuration management, user interaction design, integration with existing agent workflows, and robust error handling. The system must prevent context confusion, support aliases, handle ambiguous references, and provide auditability. Testing requirements are extensive, covering unit, integration, scenario, edge case, and user acceptance tests. Dependencies on existing configuration and project management modules increase integration complexity. The breadth of functionality, need for reliability, and high risk of subtle bugs (e.g., context confusion, incorrect project switching) make this a highly complex task, justifying a score of 9. Industry best practices recommend modularization, clear separation of concerns, and comprehensive automated testing for such systems[1][2][3][4][5][8]."

			"taskId": 79,
			"taskTitle": "Add Design Decisions and Potential Improvements Tracking to Scenario YAML",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No further expansion needed; subtasks already defined and granular.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves enhancing CLI and workflow support for YAML fields that already exist in the schema and validator, focusing on CLI commands, documentation, and templates. The technical complexity is moderate: the schema and validation logic are in place, so the main effort is in CLI UX, documentation, and ensuring smooth workflow integration. Testing is straightforward, as it involves CLI command validation and documentation review. The task is already broken down into well-scoped subtasks, so no further expansion is needed."

		{
			"taskId": 87,
			"taskTitle": "Implement UFC-Based Project Metadata Cache for Persistent State Management",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation into: (1) Directory and registry.json creation, (2) Hierarchical loading logic, (3) Symlink management for active project, (4) Integration with project switching, (5) Compliance and testing against UFC pattern.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires implementing a persistent, hierarchical cache system following the Unified Filesystem Context (UFC) pattern, including atomic symlink updates and integration with project switching. It involves non-trivial filesystem operations, concurrency considerations (atomic updates), and ensuring consistency with UFC principles. Testing must cover concurrency, atomicity, and integration with other commands. The scope is broad and touches multiple system layers, warranting decomposition into at least five subtasks."

		{
			"taskId": 88,
			"taskTitle": "Create /switch-project Slash Command",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Command file and documentation creation, (2) Command logic and validation implementation, (3) Integration with help documentation and project orchestrator.",
			"reasoning": "This task is a focused CLI enhancement that wraps existing project switching logic with additional validation and user feedback. The technical challenge is moderate, mainly involving input validation, error handling, and integration with existing logic. Testing is straightforward. While not highly complex, it benefits from being split into documentation, implementation, and integration subtasks for clarity and maintainability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 89,
			"taskTitle": "Create /list-projects Slash Command",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Command file and documentation creation, (2) Command logic for reading and formatting project data, (3) Integration with help documentation and output formatting validation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves implementing a CLI command to list projects in a tabular format, reading from config files and formatting output. The complexity is moderate due to the need for robust output formatting, edge case handling, and integration with existing project management logic. Splitting into documentation, implementation, and integration/output validation subtasks is recommended."

		{
			"taskId": 90,
			"taskTitle": "Add Project Health Metrics to metadata.json",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Schema extension and validator updates, (2) Utility function implementation, (3) Command integration for metrics update, (4) Documentation and CLI output updates.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires extending the project metadata schema, updating validation logic, implementing utility functions, and integrating with project commands. It also involves updating documentation and CLI output. The complexity is above average due to schema evolution, backward compatibility, and the need for robust validation and error handling. Four subtasks are appropriate to cover schema, utilities, integration, and documentation."

		{
			"taskId": 91,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Epic Tag Structure and Dashboard for Orchestrator Project",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Epic tag creation, (2) Task migration, (3) Dashboard HTML/CSS implementation, (4) Dashboard JS logic, (5) Documentation (EPIC_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md), (6) Testing and validation.",
			"reasoning": "This task is complex due to the need to restructure task organization, migrate a large number of tasks, and build a dynamic dashboard with both frontend and backend integration. It also requires comprehensive documentation and testing. The breadth of the task, cross-cutting concerns, and the need for robust migration and visualization logic justify a high complexity score and at least six subtasks."

		{
			"taskId": 95,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Composable Project Templates System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Template architecture refactor, (2) Merge logic implementation, (3) CLI integration and validation, (4) Conflict resolution strategy, (5) Documentation and examples.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves significant refactoring of the template system, implementing merge logic with conflict resolution, and updating CLI commands. It requires careful handling of file operations, compatibility, and user experience. Testing must cover various composition scenarios and error cases. The complexity is high due to the architectural changes and the need for robust, user-friendly error handling. Five subtasks are recommended."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 96,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Metrics Tracking System for Skills and Hooks",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Metrics schema and storage, (2) Hook system integration, (3) Skills system integration, (4) Aggregation and archiving logic, (5) CLI stats command, (6) Configuration and privacy options.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires designing a metrics schema, integrating tracking into multiple subsystems (skills and hooks), implementing aggregation and archiving, and exposing data via CLI. It also involves performance and privacy considerations. The breadth, cross-cutting nature, and need for robust, non-blocking integration make this a high-complexity task, best split into at least six subtasks."

			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No further expansion needed; subtasks already defined and granular.",
			"reasoning": "This is a minimal, well-scoped task focused on setting up a basic React dashboard shell with minimal styling. The technical complexity is low, with clear, granular subtasks already defined. No further expansion is needed."

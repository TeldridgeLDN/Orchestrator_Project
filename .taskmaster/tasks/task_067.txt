# Task ID: 67
# Title: Implement Scenario YAML Schema and Validation Engine
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 66
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a robust schema validator for scenario YAML files, enforcing all required fields and types.
# Details:
Use PyYAML (>=6.0) for parsing and jsonschema (>=4.19) for validation. Define the schema as per PRD, including nested steps, triggers, dependencies, design_decisions, and improvements. Provide CLI feedback with clear error messages. Support schema evolution via versioning.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for valid and invalid YAMLs. Include edge cases (missing fields, wrong types, deprecated keys). Use sample files from PRD and future enhancements.

# Task ID: 42
# Title: Implement Agentic Feature Selection Guide
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a decision tree framework for selecting appropriate agentic features based on task requirements.
# Details:
Develop a comprehensive guide for selecting the right agentic feature (Slash Commands, MCPs, Sub-Agents, Skills) based on task requirements:

1. Create ~/.claude/docs/AGENTIC_FEATURE_GUIDE.md with:
   - Introduction explaining the purpose of the guide
   - Decision tree with 4 steps for feature selection
   - Detailed explanations for each decision point

2. For each feature type, document:
   - Use cases and scenarios
   - Advantages and limitations
   - Implementation complexity
   - Integration considerations
   - 2-3 concrete examples

3. Include a justification template for new feature proposals with sections for:
   - Problem statement
   - Requirements analysis
   - Feature selection rationale
   - Implementation plan
   - Testing strategy

Decision tree structure:
```markdown
# Agentic Feature Selection Guide

## Decision Tree
1. Is the functionality self-contained and simple? 
   - Yes → Consider Slash Command
   - No → Continue to step 2

2. Does it require integration with external systems?
   - Yes → Consider MCP
   - No → Continue to step 3

3. Does it need to maintain state or have complex logic?
   - Yes → Continue to step 4
   - No → Reconsider Slash Command with parameters

4. Does it need to operate independently or have its own persona?
   - Yes → Consider Sub-Agent
   - No → Consider Skill
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Review guide with team members to ensure clarity
2. Test the decision tree with 5-10 example features to verify it leads to appropriate recommendations
3. Validate examples are accurate and representative
4. Check that justification template is comprehensive
5. Verify the guide aligns with existing implementation patterns

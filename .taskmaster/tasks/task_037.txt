# Task ID: 37
# Title: Create project_orchestrator Skill Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the PAI Skills-as-Containers structure for the orchestrator meta-skill, including the main skill documentation, metadata, workflows, and resources.
# Details:
Create the directory structure and core files for the project_orchestrator skill:

1. Create the base directory structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/project_orchestrator/workflows
   mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/project_orchestrator/resources
   ```

2. Create the main skill documentation file (SKILL.md):
   ```markdown
   # Project Orchestrator Skill
   
   The Project Orchestrator skill helps manage Claude projects, enabling context switching, project creation, and project management.
   
   ## Capabilities
   
   - Create new projects from templates
   - Switch between projects
   - List available projects
   - Remove projects
   - Validate project structure
   
   ## Workflows
   
   - [Create Project](workflows/create.md): Create a new project from a template
   - [Switch Project](workflows/switch.md): Switch to an existing project
   - [List Projects](workflows/list.md): List all available projects
   - [Remove Project](workflows/remove.md): Remove an existing project
   - [Validate Project](workflows/validate.md): Validate project structure
   
   ## Resources
   
   - [Templates](resources/templates.md): Available project templates
   - [Troubleshooting](resources/troubleshooting.md): Common issues and solutions
   ```

3. Create metadata.json:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "project_orchestrator",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "description": "Manages Claude projects and context switching",
     "author": "Claude Team",
     "dependencies": [],
     "activationPatterns": [
       "create project",
       "switch to project",
       "list projects",
       "remove project",
       "validate project"
     ]
   }
   ```

4. Create workflow documentation files:
   - workflows/create.md
   - workflows/switch.md
   - workflows/list.md
   - workflows/remove.md
   - workflows/validate.md

5. Create resource documentation files:
   - resources/templates.md
   - resources/troubleshooting.md

Ensure all documentation files follow the diet103 rule of being under 500 lines each.

# Test Strategy:
1. Structure validation:
   - Verify all required directories and files exist
   - Validate metadata.json format
   - Check SKILL.md content and length (<500 lines)

2. Documentation review:
   - Review all workflow documentation for completeness
   - Verify resource documentation is helpful and accurate
   - Check for broken links between documents

3. Integration test:
   - Verify the skill can be loaded by the skill manager
   - Check that activation patterns are correctly registered

# Task ID: 73
# Title: Integrate Research MCP (Perplexity or Similar) for Best Practice Discovery
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 72
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enable scenario_builder to query external research MCPs for up-to-date best practices and alternatives.
# Details:
Implement async HTTP client (httpx >=0.25) to interact with Perplexity or similar API. Cache results for performance. Handle API errors gracefully. Provide abstraction for swapping MCP providers.

# Test Strategy:
Mock MCP responses in tests. Validate correct query formation, error handling, and caching. Test fallback to local knowledge base.

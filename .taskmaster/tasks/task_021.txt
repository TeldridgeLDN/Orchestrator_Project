# Task ID: 21
# Title: Create Global Directory Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Establish the foundational directory structure for the global orchestration layer at ~/.claude/
# Details:
Create the necessary directory structure for the global orchestration layer following the PAI-inspired architecture. This includes setting up the main directories and placeholder files.

```bash
# Create main directory structure
mkdir -p ~/.claude/bin
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/project_orchestrator/actions
mkdir -p ~/.claude/templates/base/.claude
mkdir -p ~/.claude/templates/web-app/.claude/skills/web_dev_assistant
mkdir -p ~/.claude/templates/shopify/.claude/skills/shopify_skill
mkdir -p ~/.claude/templates/shopify/.claude/skills/seo_optimizer
mkdir -p ~/.claude/cache
mkdir -p ~/.claude/logs

# Create placeholder files
touch ~/.claude/config.json
touch ~/.claude/Claude.md
touch ~/.claude/skills/project_orchestrator/SKILL.md
touch ~/.claude/skills/project_orchestrator/metadata.json
touch ~/.claude/skills/project_orchestrator/hooks.yaml
```

Ensure all directories have appropriate permissions (typically 755) and files have 644 permissions. The structure should match the specification in section 7.1 of the PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the directory structure exists with the correct permissions using a shell script that checks each path. Confirm all required directories and placeholder files are created. Test with both a fresh installation and an existing installation to ensure idempotency.

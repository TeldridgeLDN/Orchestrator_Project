# Task ID: 41
# Title: Complete Skill Documentation for Project Orchestrator
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: low
# Description: Create comprehensive documentation for the project orchestrator skill including SKILL.md and workflow documentation.
# Details:
This task involves creating clear and concise documentation for the project orchestrator skill:

1. Create SKILL.md in the project root directory (under 500 lines, following diet103 rule)
   - Include overview, purpose, and capabilities
   - Document all available commands and their parameters
   - Provide usage examples with expected outputs
   - List dependencies and requirements

2. Document each workflow in the workflows/ directory:
   - Create a markdown file for each workflow
   - Include step-by-step execution flow
   - Document input/output specifications
   - Add code examples

3. Add a troubleshooting section in resources/ directory:
   - Common issues and their solutions
   - Debugging techniques
   - Known limitations

4. Address identified documentation gaps:
   - Add 'register' command documentation to SKILL.md and create its workflow documentation
   - Add configuration examples for hooks.yaml file
   - Create a quick reference/cheat sheet section in SKILL.md for common operations
   - Improve structure of CLI command reference

Implementation approach:
```javascript
// Directory structure
// ~/.claude/skills/project_orchestrator/
// ├── SKILL.md
// ├── workflows/
// │   ├── project_creation.md
// │   ├── project_switching.md
// │   ├── project_list.md
// │   ├── project_remove.md
// │   ├── project_validate.md
// │   └── project_register.md (new)
// ├── templates/
// │   ├── base.md
// │   ├── web-app.md
// │   └── shopify.md
// └── resources/
//     └── troubleshooting.md

// Example SKILL.md content structure
# Project Orchestrator Skill

## Overview
[Concise description of the skill's purpose and capabilities]

## Quick Reference
[Cheat sheet for common operations]

## Commands
[Detailed documentation of each command with parameters and examples]

## Workflows
[Overview of available workflows with links to detailed documentation]

## Integration
[How to integrate with other skills and features]

// Example hooks.yaml configuration
project_created:
  - skill: notification
    action: notify
    params:
      message: "Project {{project_name}} created successfully"
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Review documentation for completeness against implementation
2. Verify all commands and workflows are documented (including the 'register' command)
3. Check for clarity and conciseness (SKILL.md under 500 lines)
4. Have another team member review for comprehensibility
5. Validate all examples work as documented
6. Ensure troubleshooting section covers common issues
7. Verify quick reference section provides clear guidance for common operations
8. Test hooks.yaml configuration examples

# Subtasks:
## 1. Document 'register' command workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for the 'register' command that is referenced in troubleshooting but missing from SKILL.md.
### Details:
Create project_register.md in the workflows directory with:
- Command syntax and parameters
- Step-by-step execution flow
- Use cases and examples
- Common errors and solutions
- Integration with other commands

Also update SKILL.md to include this command in the commands section with proper examples and parameter descriptions.

## 2. Create hooks.yaml configuration examples [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop configuration examples for the currently empty hooks.yaml file to demonstrate proper usage.
### Details:
Create comprehensive examples for hooks.yaml configuration including:
- Event-based triggers (project_created, project_switched, etc.)
- Integration with other skills (notification, logging, etc.)
- Parameter passing and variable substitution
- Conditional execution examples
- Best practices and common patterns

Add these examples to the appropriate section in SKILL.md and create a separate hooks.md file in the resources directory with detailed explanations.

## 3. Add quick reference/cheat sheet section [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a concise quick reference section in SKILL.md for common operations to improve usability.
### Details:
Develop a well-structured quick reference section that includes:
- Most common commands with minimal syntax
- Typical workflows with single-line examples
- Frequently used parameter combinations
- Tips for efficient usage
- Common troubleshooting one-liners

Format this section for easy scanning and quick reference, using tables or bullet points for clarity. Place it near the top of SKILL.md after the overview section.

## 4. Improve CLI command reference structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Restructure the CLI command reference in SKILL.md to be more organized and easier to navigate.
### Details:
Reorganize the CLI command reference with:
- Consistent formatting for all commands
- Grouping of related commands (project management, configuration, etc.)
- Table of contents with links to each command section
- Parameter tables with types, defaults, and descriptions
- Color-coded or visually distinct examples
- Cross-references to relevant workflows and troubleshooting

Ensure the structure is consistent and makes logical sense for users trying to find specific commands quickly.

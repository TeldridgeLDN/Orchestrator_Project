# Task ID: 75
# Title: Develop Feasibility Checker Sub-Agent and Parallel Validation Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 74
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a sub-agent that validates technical feasibility of proposed integrations, running in parallel for each alternative.
# Details:
Implement feasibility_checker agent in Python using asyncio for parallel execution. Check MCP availability, API capabilities, authentication, blockers, and cost. Output [FEASIBILITY_SCORE: X/10] with analysis. Integrate with scenario_builder workflows.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test agent logic with various integration scenarios. Integration test parallel execution and result aggregation. Validate output format.

# Task ID: 68
# Title: Scaffold scenario_builder Meta-Skill Skeleton
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 66
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the foundational structure for the scenario_builder meta-skill, including workflow and resource placeholders.
# Details:
Generate SKILL.md, metadata.json, config.json, workflows/ (with .md stubs for each workflow), resources/ (with .md stubs), and agents/feasibility_checker/ (with AGENT.md and config.json). Use cookiecutter for templating. Ensure all files are discoverable by orchestrator.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all files are created with correct content and permissions. Use integration tests to ensure orchestrator can load the meta-skill.

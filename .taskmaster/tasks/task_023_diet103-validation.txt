# Task ID: 23
# Title: Comprehensive Test Suite and Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop unit, integration, and performance tests for all components. Optimize for speed and reliability.
# Details:
Use Jest v29+ for testing. Achieve >95% coverage for core modules. Test full lifecycle (create → classify → organize → archive → cleanup). Optimize critical paths for performance targets. Implement async processing where possible.

# Test Strategy:
Run coverage reports. Performance benchmarks for classification, organization, and batch processing. Reliability and edge case tests.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Write unit tests for all core modules [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop Jest unit tests for each module to ensure isolated functionality and achieve >95% coverage.
### Details:
Use Jest v29+ to write granular unit tests for each function and class. Follow best practices: descriptive names, single assertion per test, AAA pattern, and mocking external dependencies. Cover all branches and edge cases.

## 2. Implement integration test workflows [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Create integration tests that validate end-to-end workflows across modules.
### Details:
Test full lifecycle (create → classify → organize → archive → cleanup) using Jest. Ensure workflows interact correctly and data flows as expected. Mock external services where necessary.

## 3. Set up performance benchmarking [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2
### Description: Develop performance tests to measure speed and efficiency of critical paths.
### Details:
Use Jest and custom benchmarking tools to measure classification, organization, and batch processing times. Compare against performance targets and optimize as needed.

## 4. Develop edge case and reliability tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2
### Description: Write tests for edge cases, error conditions, and reliability scenarios.
### Details:
Cover boundary values, unexpected inputs, error handling, and failure recovery. Ensure system remains stable under adverse conditions.

## 5. Optimize async processing [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2, 23.3
### Description: Refactor critical paths to use async processing for improved performance.
### Details:
Identify bottlenecks and implement async/await or Promise-based solutions. Ensure async logic is thoroughly tested and does not introduce race conditions.

## 6. Implement coverage reporting and CI integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2, 23.3, 23.4, 23.5
### Description: Set up coverage reporting and integrate tests into CI/CD pipeline.
### Details:
Configure Jest coverage reports and integrate with CI/CD tools. Ensure coverage thresholds are enforced and reports are generated on every build.

## 7. Conduct regression and stress testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2, 23.3, 23.4, 23.5, 23.6
### Description: Perform regression and stress tests to ensure system stability under load.
### Details:
Run regression tests after changes and stress tests to simulate high load scenarios. Monitor for memory leaks, crashes, and performance degradation.

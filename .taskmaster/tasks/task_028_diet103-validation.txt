# Task ID: 28
# Title: Build MCP Ecosystem Integration and Discovery System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 27
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the infrastructure for MCP discovery, registration, and integration, enabling scenario_builder to query available MCPs, validate API capabilities, and estimate costs.
# Details:
Implement a registry system for MCPs, using a local registry file (`mcp_registry.md`/JSON) and support for dynamic discovery via network queries. Integrate with API Documentation MCP and Cost Calculator MCP using OpenAPI or GraphQL where available. Ensure secure API key management and support for OAuth2 where required. Provide CLI commands for MCP installation and discovery. Document available MCPs and their capabilities. Follow best practices for modular integration, including clear data contracts and error handling. Ensure the system is extensible for future MCPs and supports versioning and capability negotiation[3][4][5].

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests for MCP discovery and API validation. Security tests for credential handling. CLI tests for MCP management commands.

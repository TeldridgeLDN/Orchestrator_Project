# Task ID: 25
# Title: Develop scenario_builder Meta-Skill Skeleton and Core Workflows
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 24
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the foundational scenario_builder meta-skill, including core workflows for scenario creation, analysis, scaffolding, and validation.
# Details:
Create the directory structure under `~/.claude/skills/scenario_builder/` with subfolders for workflows, resources, and agents. Implement the following workflows as Markdown-driven or code-backed modules: `create_scenario.md`, `analyze_scenario.md`, `scaffold_components.md`, and `validate_scenario.md`. Use a workflow engine such as Temporal (v1.23+) or Prefect (v2.x) for orchestration, or a lightweight custom orchestrator if dependencies must be minimized. Workflows should interact with the scenario YAML files, generate implementation components in `~/.claude/`, and provide clear CLI feedback. Ensure modularity for future partnership workflows. Use dependency injection for extensibility.

# Test Strategy:
Workflow unit tests with mocked scenario files. End-to-end CLI tests for scenario creation and validation. Snapshot tests for generated components.

# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Gap Analysis Engine
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the gap analysis system to calculate diet103 infrastructure completeness
# Details:
The analyzeDiet103Gaps() function has already been implemented in diet103-validator.js during Task 1 with the following features:

- Weighted scoring algorithm (Critical 70%, Important 30%)
- Completeness score calculation (0-100%)
- Missing component categorization
- Classification levels (Perfect, Nearly Complete, Incomplete, Severely Incomplete)
- Detailed gap reporting

All unit tests for gap analysis are already passing (6 tests):
- 0% score for empty projects
- 100% score for complete projects  
- Partial score calculations
- Classification logic
- Missing component identification

No additional implementation work is needed for this task as it was completed as part of Task 1.

# Test Strategy:
All unit tests for the gap analysis engine have already been implemented and are passing:
1. Correct score calculation
2. Accurate missing component identification
3. Completeness flag setting
4. Edge cases with minimal/maximal infrastructure (0% and 100% scores)
5. Weighted scoring accuracy
6. Classification logic verification

# Subtasks:
## 1. Document existing gap analysis implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create documentation for the analyzeDiet103Gaps() function that was implemented during Task 1
### Details:
Document the existing implementation of analyzeDiet103Gaps() in diet103-validator.js, including:
- The weighted scoring algorithm (70% critical, 30% important)
- Completeness score calculation methodology
- Classification levels (Perfect, Nearly Complete, Incomplete, Severely Incomplete)
- Component categorization approach
- Integration with the rest of the validation system

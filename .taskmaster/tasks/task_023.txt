# Task ID: 23
# Title: Create Global Claude.md Template
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 21
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the global Claude.md template that defines orchestrator behavior and meta-level rules
# Details:
Create the global Claude.md file that will serve as the orchestration context for the system. This file defines the meta-level rules and behavior for the orchestrator.

The implementation has been completed successfully with the creation of the Global AI Orchestration Layer section in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md. The file consists of 187 lines covering the following key components:

1. Orchestration principles (single active context, context isolation, explicit switching)
2. Active project configuration
3. Project orchestrator skill capabilities
4. Token efficiency strategy
5. Project templates
6. Workflow examples
7. diet103 integration
8. Usage guidelines

The file follows PAI principles and is designed to be readable and maintainable.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the Claude.md file is created with the correct content. Test that it loads properly into Claude's context by making a request that references the orchestration rules. Ensure the token count is within the specified limit (~500 tokens) by measuring token usage with and without this file loaded. Additionally, validate that all the newly added sections (project templates, workflow examples, diet103 integration, and usage guidelines) function as expected.

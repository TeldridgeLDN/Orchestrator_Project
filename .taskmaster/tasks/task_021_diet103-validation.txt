# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 17, 18, 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop CLI commands for classify, organize, archive, cleanup, status, and stats workflows.
# Details:
Use commander v10+ for CLI scaffolding. Implement each command to invoke corresponding workflow. Provide options for dry-run, verbose output, and config overrides. Ensure help and usage guides are clear.

# Test Strategy:
Unit and integration tests for each CLI command. Usability and error handling tests.

# Subtasks:
## 1. CLI Scaffolding and Command Registration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the CLI application using commander v10+ and register all required commands (classify, organize, archive, cleanup, status, stats).
### Details:
Initialize the CLI app with commander v10+. Register each workflow command with basic structure and placeholder handlers. Ensure commands are accessible and registered correctly.

### Description: Generate clear help and usage guides for all commands and options.
### Details:
Ensure each command has descriptive help text and usage examples. Use commander's built-in help features and customize as needed.

## 6. Usability and Error Handling Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.2, 21.3, 21.4, 21.5
### Description: Write usability and error handling tests for the CLI commands.
### Details:

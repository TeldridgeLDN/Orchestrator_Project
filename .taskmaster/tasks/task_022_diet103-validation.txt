# Task ID: 22
# Title: diet103 Validation System Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 15, 17, 21
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate with diet103 validation to provide organization scoring, misplaced file detection, and auto-repair recommendations.
# Details:
Implement validation hooks to scan manifest and directory structure. Calculate organization percentage. Suggest and optionally apply auto-repair actions. Ensure compatibility with diet103 API.

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests for validation and scoring. Auto-repair recommendation tests. Compatibility checks.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate Validation Hooks for Manifest and Directory Scanning [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement hooks to scan project manifest and directory structure using diet103 validation system.
### Details:
Set up validation hooks in the project to automatically trigger scans of the manifest and directory structure. Ensure hooks are compatible with diet103 API and capture all relevant data for scoring and detection.

## 2. Develop Organization Scoring Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1
### Description: Create logic to calculate organization percentage based on validation results.
### Details:
Implement scoring algorithm that processes validation data to compute an organization percentage. Ensure scoring is consistent with diet103 standards and reflects project organization accurately.

## 3. Implement Misplaced File Detection [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1
### Description: Add functionality to detect files that are misplaced according to diet103 guidelines.
### Details:
Develop detection logic to identify files not in expected locations. Integrate with validation hooks and ensure results are included in validation reports.

## 4. Build Auto-Repair Recommendation and Application System [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.2, 22.3
### Description: Create system to suggest and optionally apply auto-repair actions for detected issues.
### Details:
Implement recommendation engine that suggests repairs based on validation results. Add option to apply repairs automatically, ensuring compatibility with diet103 API and project structure.

## 5. Conduct Compatibility and Integration Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1, 22.2, 22.3, 22.4
### Description: Perform comprehensive tests to ensure compatibility with diet103 API and overall system integration.
### Details:
Run integration tests covering all aspects of validation, scoring, detection, and auto-repair. Verify compatibility with diet103 API and handle edge cases.

# Task ID: 9
# Title: Comprehensive Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop end-to-end tests and integration test suite
# Details:
Create comprehensive test suite covering:
- Unit tests for each module
- Integration tests for commands
- Performance benchmarks
- Edge case and error handling tests
- Validation of diet103 1.2.0 specification compliance

Test coverage targets:
- Detection logic: >95%
- Gap analysis: >90%
- Repair system: >85%
- Command integrations: 100%

# Test Strategy:
Multi-level testing approach:
1. Isolated unit tests for each function
2. Integration tests for complete workflows
3. Performance and stress testing
4. Extensive edge case coverage
5. Benchmark performance against targets

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop Unit Tests for Each Module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create isolated unit tests to verify the correctness of individual modules and functions.
### Details:
Implement automated unit tests for all core modules using the project's preferred testing framework. Ensure coverage targets are met for detection logic (>95%), gap analysis (>90%), and repair system (>85%). Include tests for normal, boundary, and error conditions.

## 2. Implement Integration Tests for Command Workflows [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Design and execute integration tests to verify interactions between modules and command workflows.
### Details:
Create integration tests that simulate real-world command usage, ensuring modules interact correctly. Cover all command integrations to achieve 100% coverage. Test scenarios should include typical workflows, error propagation, and edge cases.

## 3. Establish Performance Benchmarks and Stress Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Measure and validate system performance under typical and extreme conditions.
### Details:
Develop performance and stress tests for critical workflows, focusing on detection, gap analysis, and repair operations. Benchmark against defined performance targets and identify bottlenecks. Use profiling tools to monitor resource usage and response times.

## 4. Design Edge Case and Error Handling Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Create tests to validate system behavior under unusual, invalid, or unexpected conditions.
### Details:
Identify and document edge cases for all modules and commands. Implement tests for invalid inputs, boundary values, and error scenarios. Ensure robust error handling and graceful failure modes are covered.

## 5. Validate Compliance with diet103 1.2.0 Specification [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Ensure all tests and system behaviors conform to the diet103 1.2.0 specification requirements.
### Details:
Review the diet103 1.2.0 specification and map requirements to test cases. Implement validation tests to confirm compliance for all relevant features and workflows. Document any gaps and address non-compliance issues.

# Task ID: 66
# Title: Establish Scenario Directory Structure and File Conventions
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the required directory and file structure for scenario management, ensuring alignment with the three-layer architecture.
# Details:
Create the following directories: ~/.claude/scenarios/ for scenario YAMLs, ~/.claude/skills/scenario_builder/ for meta-skill workflows and resources, ~/.claude/agents/feasibility_checker/ for sub-agent configs, and <project>/.claude/ for project-specific overrides. Use Python 3.11+ (for best async support) and pathlib for cross-platform compatibility. Enforce file naming and schema conventions as per PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test directory creation and file permissions. Validate that all required folders and example files are present after setup. Use pytest and mock filesystem for tests.

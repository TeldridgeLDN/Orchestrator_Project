# Task ID: 76
# Title: Implement test_feasibility and proof_of_concept Workflows
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 75
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enable scenario_builder to validate technical possibility and run proof-of-concept tests before full deployment.
# Details:
Write test_feasibility.md and proof_of_concept.md workflows. Use feasibility_checker agent for validation. For proof of concept, scaffold minimal scenario, test API connections, and validate data flow. Provide user with demo and blockers.

# Test Strategy:
Test with sample integrations (e.g., Airtable, Google Forms). Validate that blockers are detected early and demo is functional.

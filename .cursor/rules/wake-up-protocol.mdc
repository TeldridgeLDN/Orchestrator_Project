# Wake-Up Protocol

**CRITICAL: This protocol MUST execute when the user starts a session with any of these phrases:**
- "wake up"
- "good morning" / "good afternoon" / "good evening"
- "let's start"
- "ready"
- "begin"
- Or any greeting at the start of a fresh conversation

## The Wake-Up Sequence

Execute these steps IN ORDER when triggered:

### 1. Verify Project Identity (30 seconds)
```bash
# Confirm working directory
pwd

# Read project configuration
cat .taskmaster/config.json | grep projectName

# Read package.json for project info
cat package.json | grep -E "name|version|description"
```

**Expected Output:**
- Directory: `/Users/tomeldridge/Orchestrator_Project`
- Project Name: `Orchestrator_Project`
- Version: Current version from package.json

### 2. Load AI Model Configuration (15 seconds)
```bash
# Read AI model setup
cat .taskmaster/config.json
```

**Verify:**
- Main model configured
- Research model configured
- Fallback model configured
- API keys available (check MCP config if needed)

### 3. Load Taskmaster Context (45 seconds)
```javascript
// Get current task status
mcp_task-master-ai_get_tasks({
  projectRoot: "/Users/tomeldridge/Orchestrator_Project",
  status: "pending,in-progress"
})

// Identify next task
mcp_task-master-ai_next_task({
  projectRoot: "/Users/tomeldridge/Orchestrator_Project"
})

// List available tags
mcp_task-master-ai_list_tags({
  projectRoot: "/Users/tomeldridge/Orchestrator_Project"
})
```

**Capture:**
- Total pending/in-progress tasks
- Next task ID and title
- Current tag context
- Available tag contexts

### 4. Check Git Status (10 seconds)
```bash
# Current branch and status
git branch --show-current
git status --short

# Recent commits (last 3)
git log --oneline -3
```

**Note:**
- Current branch name
- Uncommitted changes count
- Recent work context

### 5. Load Active Memories (5 seconds)

Review the `<memories>` section already loaded in context for:
- Current project focus
- Recent implementation decisions
- Known blockers or issues
- Cross-project context

### 6. Present Wake-Up Report (5 seconds)

Output a structured report:

```
🌅 WAKE-UP REPORT
═══════════════════════════════════════════

📍 PROJECT CONTEXT
  • Directory: /Users/tomeldridge/Orchestrator_Project
  • Project: [name from package.json]
  • Version: [version]
  • Git Branch: [current branch]
  • Uncommitted Changes: [count]

🤖 AI CONFIGURATION
  • Main Model: [model name] ([tokens]k tokens)
  • Research Model: [model name]
  • Fallback Model: [model name]
  • Critical Review: [enabled/disabled]

📋 TASKMASTER STATUS
  • Current Tag: [tag name]
  • Available Tags: [count] contexts
  • Pending Tasks: [count]
  • In-Progress Tasks: [count]
  • Next Task: [id] - [title]
    - Priority: [priority]
    - Type: [task/subtask]
    - Dependencies: [status]

💭 ACTIVE MEMORIES
  • [Key memory 1]
  • [Key memory 2]
  • [Key memory 3]

🎯 READY STATE
All systems loaded. Awaiting your direction.

## Execution Rules

### DO:
✅ Execute this sequence automatically without asking
✅ Run all steps in parallel where possible (project identity + git status + taskmaster)
✅ Present the complete report even if some steps fail (note failures)
✅ Cache the loaded context for the session
✅ Re-run if user says "refresh" or "reload"

### DON'T:
❌ Ask "Do you want me to load context?" - just do it
❌ Skip steps because "it might not be relevant"
❌ Stop if one step fails - complete all steps and report issues
❌ Re-run the protocol mid-conversation unless explicitly requested

## Failure Handling

If any step fails:
1. Continue with remaining steps
2. Note the failure in the report
3. Suggest fixes if known (e.g., "MCP server not responding - restart recommended")

## Performance Optimization

- **Target Time:** Complete sequence in < 2 minutes
- Use parallel tool calls for independent operations
- Cache results in conversation context
- Don't re-fetch unchanged data within the same session

## Why This Exists

**Problem:** Agent inconsistently loaded project context at session start, leading to:
- Missed project validation
- Incomplete task awareness
- Lost configuration context
- Repeated questions about project state

**Solution:** Explicit, automatic, comprehensive wake-up sequence triggered by common session-start phrases.

*When the user says "wake up," they mean "load everything you need to help me effectively."*

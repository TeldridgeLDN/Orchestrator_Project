design_decisions:
  - decision: "Use milestone-based payments (30-40-30)"
    rationale: "Reduces financial risk for both agency and client while maintaining cash flow"
    alternatives_considered:
      - "Full upfront payment (too risky for clients)"
      - "Payment on completion (too risky for agency)"
    trade_offs: "Requires payment processing at multiple touchpoints but provides better risk management"
  
  - decision: "Automated form generation based on package tier"
    rationale: "Different package sizes require different levels of detail in requirements"
    alternatives_considered:
      - "Single universal form (too generic)"
      - "Fully custom forms per client (too time-consuming)"
    trade_offs: "Requires maintaining multiple form templates but provides better client experience"

## Overview

Brief description of what this project/feature does and why it exists.

Example:
"This project is a REST API for managing user authentication and authorization 
in a multi-tenant SaaS application. It will handle user registration, login, 
session management, and role-based access control."

---

## Goals

What are we trying to achieve?

1. Primary Goal: [Main objective]
2. Secondary Goal: [Supporting objective]
3. Success Metrics: [How we measure success]

Example:
1. Primary Goal: Secure, scalable authentication system
2. Secondary Goal: Easy integration with existing services
3. Success Metrics: 
   - Support 10,000 concurrent users
   - < 100ms response time for auth requests
   - Zero downtime deployments

---

## User Stories

Who will use this and what will they do?

Format: "As a [role], I want to [action] so that [benefit]"

Example:
- As a new user, I want to register an account so that I can access the platform
- As a registered user, I want to log in securely so that I can use the application
- As an admin, I want to manage user roles so that I can control access permissions

---

## Functional Requirements

What must the system do?

### Core Features

1. **User Registration**
   - Email/password registration
   - Email verification
   - Password strength validation
   - Duplicate email detection

2. **Authentication**
   - Login with email/password
   - JWT token generation
   - Refresh token rotation
   - Session management

3. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Permission checking
   - Multi-tenant isolation

### Additional Features

4. **Security**
   - Password hashing (bcrypt)
   - Rate limiting
   - CSRF protection
   - SQL injection prevention

5. **Administration**
   - User management API
   - Role management
   - Audit logging

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

How should it behave?

### Performance
- API response time < 100ms (95th percentile)
- Support 10,000 concurrent sessions
- Handle 1,000 requests/second

### Security
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- SOC 2 compliance
- Encrypted data at rest and in transit

### Reliability
- 99.9% uptime
- Automated backups every 6 hours
- Disaster recovery plan

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling support
- Stateless design
- Containerized deployment

---

## Technical Constraints

What are the limitations or requirements?

### Technology Stack
- Backend: Node.js 18+ / Python 3.11+
- Database: PostgreSQL 15+
- Cache: Redis 7+
- Deployment: Docker + Kubernetes

### Integration Requirements
- Must integrate with existing API gateway
- Must use company SSO for admin access
- Must log to centralized logging system

### Compliance
- GDPR compliance for EU users
- CCPA compliance for CA users
- Data retention policies

---

## Out of Scope

What are we explicitly NOT doing?

- OAuth2 social login (future phase)
- Two-factor authentication (future phase)
- Password reset via SMS (future phase)
- Mobile app (separate project)

---

## Dependencies

What do we need before we can start?

### External Dependencies
- Access to production database
- API gateway configuration
- SSL certificates
- Email service provider account

### Team Dependencies
- Security review by InfoSec team
- UX design for registration flow
- Legal approval for terms of service

---

## Milestones & Timeline

What are the key checkpoints?

### Phase 1: MVP (4 weeks)
- Basic registration
- Login/logout
- JWT authentication
- Simple RBAC

### Phase 2: Production Ready (2 weeks)
- Rate limiting
- Audit logging
- Admin APIs
- Documentation

### Phase 3: Enhancement (2 weeks)
- Performance optimization
- Monitoring & alerting
- Load testing
- Security audit

---

## Success Criteria

How do we know we're done?

### Definition of Done
- All functional requirements implemented
- 80%+ test coverage
- Security scan passes
- Performance benchmarks met
- Documentation complete
- Deployed to production

### Acceptance Tests
- User can register and receive verification email
- User can log in and receive valid JWT token
- Admin can assign roles to users
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- System handles 10,000 concurrent users

---

## Open Questions

What do we still need to figure out?

1. Should we support single sign-on (SSO)?
2. What's the token expiration policy?
3. How do we handle password resets?
4. What monitoring tools should we use?

---

## Additional Notes

Any other relevant information.

Example:
"This system will replace the existing authentication service, which is 
currently a bottleneck. We need to plan a migration strategy for existing 
users. Backward compatibility is required during the transition period."

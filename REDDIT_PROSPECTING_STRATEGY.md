# Reddit Prospecting Strategy for Portfolio-Redesign Subdomain

**Date:** November 10, 2025  
**Target Audience:** New founders & SMBs testing ideas with quick landing pages  
**Core Offering:** Pre-Launch Landing Page Checklist + Fast validation services  
**Strategy:** High-value engagement → Lead magnet → Consultation booking

---

## Executive Summary

Reddit is a goldmine for finding founders in the early stages of building. However, success on Reddit requires a fundamentally different approach than traditional advertising:

1. **Value-first, sales-never** - Redditors despise overt marketing
2. **Community participation** - Must contribute genuinely before promoting
3. **Content disguised as advice** - Your checklist is perfect for this
4. **Long-game strategy** - Build reputation over weeks/months

**Key Objective:** Position yourself as the helpful expert who founders turn to for landing page advice, naturally leading them to your checklist and services.

## Part 2: Content Strategy (Value-First Approach)

### Format 1: "I'll Review Your Landing Page" Posts

**Example Post for r/startups:**

```
Title: I'll review 5 landing pages this week (free, detailed feedback)

Hi r/startups,

I'm a designer who's reviewed 500+ landing pages over the past year. 

I've noticed most founders make the same 5 mistakes—stuff that kills 
conversions but is easy to fix.

This week, I'll do detailed reviews for the first 5 people who comment 
with their landing page URL.

**What you'll get:**
• 3-5 specific improvements (ranked by impact)
• Side-by-side examples of before/after
• A quick Loom video walking through my feedback (if time permits)

**What I'm looking for:**
Early-stage landing pages (pre-launch or just launched). Doesn't matter 
if it's ugly—I'm focused on messaging and structure.

Drop your URL below 👇

---

EDIT: Wow, didn't expect this response! I'm going through these now. 
If I don't get to yours this week, I'll post the common mistakes I found 
so everyone can benefit.
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Genuine value with no obvious pitch
- ✅ Time-limited (creates urgency)
- ✅ Proves expertise without bragging
- ✅ Builds your comment history as a helpful expert

**When to mention your checklist:**
- In comments when people ask follow-ups
- In the summary post showing common mistakes
- In DMs to people who got reviews

---

### Format 2: "Lessons Learned" Case Study Posts

**Example Post for r/EntrepreneurRideAlong:**

```
Title: I analyzed 500 landing pages. Here are the 5 mistakes that kill 
conversions (with examples)

Over the past year, I've reviewed hundreds of landing pages from first-time 
founders. Same mistakes keep appearing.

Here are the top 5 (with fixes):

**1. Burying the benefit below the fold**

BAD: "Leverage cutting-edge AI for workflow optimization"
GOOD: "Cut your admin time in half with AI"

Why this matters: You have 5 seconds. Make it clear.

**2. No social proof**

Founders think: "I don't have testimonials yet"
Reality: Show ANYTHING—beta users, Twitter shoutouts, even "Used by 
50 beta testers"

**3. Asking for too much too soon**

Don't ask for:
❌ Name, email, company, phone, budget, timeline
✅ Just email

Lower friction = higher conversions.

**4. Unclear CTA**

BAD: "Submit" or "Learn More"
GOOD: "Get Free Checklist" or "Start Free Trial"

Be specific about what happens next.

**5. No urgency or scarcity**

If there's no reason to act now, people won't.
Add: "Only 10 beta spots left" or "Early pricing ends Friday"

---

**Bonus:** I put together a full checklist covering these + 10 more 
mistakes. If you want it, DM me (don't want to spam links here).

**Questions:** What mistakes am I missing? Drop them below 👇
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Immediately valuable (actionable tips)
- ✅ Demonstrates expertise through pattern recognition
- ✅ Invites discussion (increases engagement = more visibility)
- ✅ Mentions checklist without being salesy
- ✅ Respects subreddit rules (no direct links)

**Expected Results:**
- 50-100+ upvotes (good engagement)
- 20-30 DM requests for checklist
- Builds your Reddit reputation

---

### Format 3: "Ask Me Anything" (AMA) Style

**Example Post for r/SideProject:**

```
Title: I've built 50+ landing pages and reviewed 500 more. AMA about 
landing page strategy

Hey r/SideProject,

I've spent the past 2 years obsessed with landing pages:
• Built 50+ for clients and personal projects
• Reviewed 500+ pages from founders
• Read every book/article on conversion optimization

I keep seeing the same questions pop up, so figured I'd do an AMA.

**Ask me anything about:**
- Landing page copy/messaging
- Design that actually converts
- Quick validation on a budget
- Tools & platforms (Webflow, Carrd, etc.)
- What to test first

I'll be here for the next few hours answering questions.

Fire away! 👇
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Positions you as an expert
- ✅ Generates lots of engagement (good for Reddit algorithm)
- ✅ You control the narrative
- ✅ Natural place to share resources

**When to run:** After you've built reputation (Month 2+)

---

### Format 4: "Before/After" Transformation Posts

**Example Post for r/roastmystartup:**

```
Title: Here's what I changed in my landing page to get from 12% → 41% 
conversion (before/after)

Context: I launched my side project last month with a landing page that 
converted at 12%. Not great.

I spent a weekend applying the principles from Monzo's design team 
(they're obsessed with UX). Conversion jumped to 41%.

**Here's what I changed:**

[Before Screenshot]
❌ Headline buried the benefit
❌ No clear CTA above fold
❌ Trust indicators at bottom

[After Screenshot]
✅ Benefit in headline (5-second test)
✅ Single CTA, above fold
✅ Trust badges right under hero

**The biggest lesson?**
Simplicity > cleverness. Most founders (including me) overthink it.

**Full breakdown:** [Link to blog post on your portfolio]

Happy to answer questions about the process 👇
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Shows real results (credible)
- ✅ People love before/after transformations
- ✅ Includes visual proof
- ✅ Positions your portfolio subdomain as proof of concept

**Link Placement:**
- ✅ Linking to your own blog/portfolio is generally allowed
- ❌ Don't link directly to lead capture page

---

## Part 3: Engagement Tactics (Building Trust)

### Tactic 1: The "Reply Within 30 Minutes" Rule

**Strategy:** Set up Reddit keyword alerts for:
- "landing page feedback"
- "validate my idea"
- "first 100 customers"
- "landing page critique"

**Tools:**
- F5Bot (tracks Reddit keywords, emails you)
- Reddit Alerts (Chrome extension)
- RSS feed for specific subreddits

**What to do:**
1. Get notified when someone posts about landing pages
2. Reply within 30 minutes (be among first responders)
3. Give genuinely helpful feedback
4. Mention checklist subtly if relevant

**Example Reply:**

```
Hey! Just took a look at your landing page. Here are 3 quick wins:

1. Your headline is buried below the logo. Move "AI-powered task 
   management" to the top—make it the first thing people see.

2. CTA button says "Submit." Change to "Start Free Trial"—be specific 
   about what happens next.

3. No social proof above the fold. Add a simple "Trusted by 50+ teams" 
   or show a testimonial.

These are pretty common mistakes. I have a full checklist I use when 
reviewing pages—happy to send it if you want. Just DM me.

Good luck with the launch! 🚀
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Helpful first (no sales pitch)
- ✅ Specific, actionable advice
- ✅ Mentions checklist as an afterthought
- ✅ Builds your comment karma

---

### Tactic 2: The "Roast with Love" Approach

**Where to use:** r/roastmystartup, r/IMadeThis

**Framework:**
1. **Start with something positive** ("Love the design aesthetic")
2. **Give 3 specific critiques** (use your checklist framework)
3. **End with encouragement** ("Small tweaks will get you to X%")
4. **Offer resource** ("Want the full checklist I use?")

**Example:**

```
Love the clean design—immediately feels professional.

Here's what would make this convert better:

❌ Headline is too vague: "The future of work"
✅ Try: "Manage your team's tasks in one place (no more spreadsheets)"

❌ CTA is below the fold—only 50% of visitors scroll
✅ Move "Start Free Trial" button above the fold

❌ No trust indicators—I don't know who uses this
✅ Add: "Trusted by 200+ remote teams" or show logos

Small tweaks but could 2x your conversions. Keep going! 🚀

P.S. I have a landing page checklist that covers this stuff—DM if you want it.
```

**Impact:**
- Builds goodwill (you're helping, not selling)
- People often ask follow-up questions → natural lead gen
- Your comment history becomes your portfolio

---

### Tactic 3: "Show, Don't Tell" Portfolio Strategy

**Strategy:** Use your validation subdomain as proof

**When someone asks:** "How do I validate my idea quickly?"

**Your reply:**

```
I built a validation subdomain specifically for this (validate.yourdomain.com).

Here's the process I used:
1. Created a dead-simple landing page (took 1 weekend)
2. Offered a free checklist to capture emails
3. Got 50 signups in the first week
4. Emailed them to ask what they struggled with most
5. Booked 10 calls based on responses

Total cost: $20 (domain + Carrd subscription)
Time: One weekend + ongoing optimization

Happy to walk you through the exact steps if helpful.
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ You're showing your process, not selling
- ✅ Demonstrates you've done this successfully
- ✅ Invites DMs (private sales conversation)

---

## Part 4: Reddit Ad Strategy (Paid Complement)

### Campaign 1: Subreddit Targeting

**Target Subreddits:**
- r/startups
- r/Entrepreneur
- r/SideProject

**Ad Format:** Promoted Post (looks native)

**Creative:**

```
Title: "5 landing page mistakes that kill conversions (and how to fix them)"

[Image: Split-screen before/after of a landing page]

Body:
I've reviewed 500+ landing pages from founders. Same mistakes keep appearing.

Here are the top 5:
1. Burying the benefit below the fold
2. No social proof
3. Vague CTAs
[...]

✓ Used by 100+ founders
✓ Takes 20 minutes to implement
✓ No fluff, just actionable steps
```

**Budget:** $10-20/day to start

**Expected Results:**
- Cost per click: $0.50-1.50
- Clicks per day: 10-20
- Email opt-ins: 4-8 per day (40% conversion)
- Cost per lead: $2.50-5.00

---

### Campaign 2: Question-Based Targeting

**Ad Format:** Promoted Post

**Creative:**

```
Title: "Founders: Is your landing page missing these 5 elements?"

Most landing pages fail because they skip the fundamentals.

Take this 2-minute quiz:
☐ Is your main benefit in the headline?
☐ Do you have social proof above the fold?
☐ Is your CTA specific and obvious?
☐ Do you address objections?
☐ Is there a reason to act now?

If you checked fewer than 4 boxes, your landing page is leaving 
money on the table.

Free download. No email required.
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Interactive (quiz format)
- ✅ Immediately valuable
- ✅ Low friction ("No email required" reduces skepticism)

**Note:** You DO ask for email on landing page, but lowering barrier in ad copy increases clicks.

```

**In the DM:**

```
Hey [Name]!

Here's the Pre-Launch Landing Page Checklist: [Link to landing page]

It covers the 5 must-haves + 10 common mistakes.

Let me know if you have questions after going through it—happy to 
do a quick review of your page if helpful.

Cheers,
Tom
```

**Why DM instead of public link:**
- ✅ Respects subreddit rules (most ban promotional links)
- ✅ Starts a private conversation
- ✅ Feels more personal

---

### Step 2: Landing Page → Email Capture

**Your validation subdomain landing page should have:**

```
[Hero]
Get Your Pre-Launch Landing Page Checklist

[Subhead]
The 5-step framework 500+ founders used to validate their ideas

[Email Form]
Enter your email: [__________]

[CTA Button]

- Share case study or tip
- Soft CTA: "Want feedback on your page? Reply with the link"

**Email 7 (Day 7):**
- Offer free 30-min audit
- Calendar link

---

## Part 7: Reddit-Specific Best Practices

### Do's ✅

1. **Be genuinely helpful first**
   - Give value before ever mentioning your service
   - 90% helpful, 10% promotional

2. **Respect subreddit rules**
   - Read pinned posts and rules sidebar
   - Don't post direct promotional links
   - Use DMs for lead magnet sharing

3. **Engage consistently**
   - Reddit rewards consistent contributors
   - Set aside 30-60 min/day for engagement

4. **Use conversational tone**
   - Drop the corporate speak
   - Write like you're texting a friend

5. **Show your work**
   - Share your validation subdomain as a case study
   - Document your journey (founders love transparency)

6. **Upvote and comment on others' posts**
   - Karma matters (both literally and figuratively)
   - Support other founders = they support you

---

### Don'ts ❌

1. **Never drop links in first comment**
   - Instant downvote + ban risk
   - Build trust first, promote later

2. **Don't copy-paste replies**
   - Reddit can detect this
   - Users can see your comment history

3. **Never argue or be defensive**
   - If someone disagrees, acknowledge and move on
   - Your comment history is your reputation

4. **Don't spam multiple subreddits**
   - Cross-posting is fine, but space it out
   - Tailor each post to the subreddit

5. **Avoid obvious sales pitches**
   - "Check out my service" = instant downvote
   - "Here's what worked for me" = upvotes

6. **Don't ignore negative feedback**
   - If your post flops, learn from it
   - Reddit is honest (brutally so)

---

## Part 8: Success Metrics & Tracking

### Reddit-Specific KPIs

| Metric | Month 1 | Month 2 | Month 3 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Post karma gained | 200+ | 500+ | 1,000+ |
| Comment karma gained | 100+ | 300+ | 500+ |
| DM requests for checklist | 20 | 40 | 80 |
| Landing page visits (from Reddit) | 100 | 250 | 500 |
| Email opt-ins (Reddit source) | 40 | 100 | 200 |
| Consultation bookings | 4 | 10 | 20 |

---

### Tracking Setup

**Use UTM parameters for all Reddit links:**

```
Landing page link structure:
yourdomain.com/checklist?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=comment&utm_campaign=r_startups
```

**Track in Google Analytics:**
- Source: reddit
- Medium: comment, post, dm, ad
- Campaign: subreddit name

**Monitor:**
- Which subreddits drive most traffic
- Which post formats get most engagement
- Conversion rate by subreddit source

---

## Part 9: Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid

### Pitfall 1: Coming Across as Salesy

**Problem:** First post is a pitch → instant downvotes

**Solution:**
- Lurk for 2 weeks before posting
- Comment on 10+ posts first (build karma)
- First post = pure value (no CTA)

---

### Pitfall 2: Inconsistent Engagement

**Problem:** Post once, disappear for a month → no momentum

**Solution:**
- Set daily reminder (9am: check Reddit)
- Batch replies (reply to 5 posts in 20 minutes)
- Use F5Bot alerts to stay notified

---

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring Subreddit Culture

**Problem:** Post same content in r/startups and r/Entrepreneur → one flops

**Solution:**
- Tailor tone to each subreddit
- r/startups = technical, data-driven
- r/Entrepreneur = motivational, story-driven

---

### Pitfall 4: No Clear Next Step

**Problem:** Great post, lots of engagement, but no leads captured

**Solution:**
- Always include soft CTA: "DM me if you want X"
- Mention checklist in comments (not main post)
- Follow up with engaged commenters via DM

---

## Part 10: Advanced Tactics (Month 2+)

### Tactic 1: Reddit Profile Optimization

**Your profile should be your mini-portfolio:**

- **Bio:** "Designer helping founders validate ideas with landing pages. I've reviewed 500+ pages. DM for free feedback."
- **Pinned post:** Link to your best Reddit post (before/after case study)
- **Profile banner:** Clean, professional (not salesy)

**Why:** When people click your username, they should immediately understand your expertise.

---

### Tactic 2: Cross-Subreddit Campaigns

**Strategy:** Coordinate posts across multiple subreddits

**Example:**
- **Day 1:** Post "5 Mistakes" in r/startups
- **Day 3:** Share same content (different angle) in r/Entrepreneur
- **Day 5:** Post before/after transformation in r/SideProject

**Result:** Maximize reach without appearing spammy

---

### Tactic 3: Collaborate with Other Redditors

**Find:** Other designers, developers, or founders in your target subreddits

**Reach out via DM:**

```
Hey [Name],

Saw your post in r/startups about [topic]. Really insightful.

I'm working on something similar (landing page validation). Would 
love to compare notes sometime.

If you're up for it, maybe we could do a joint post: "2 founders 
share what worked/didn't work."

Let me know!

Tom
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Builds genuine relationships
- ✅ Larger reach (combined audiences)
- ✅ Social proof (endorsed by peer)

---

### Tactic 4: Reddit → YouTube → Reddit Loop

**Strategy:**

1. **Record:** Loom videos of landing page reviews
2. **Upload:** Edit and upload to YouTube
3. **Post to Reddit:** "I reviewed 10 landing pages (video breakdown)"
4. **Result:** YouTube views + Reddit karma + credibility

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Video reviews are more engaging than text
- ✅ YouTube builds your portfolio
- ✅ Reddit drives views to YouTube
- ✅ Creates content flywheel

---

## Part 11: Budget & ROI Projection

### Organic Reddit Strategy (Time Investment)

| Activity | Time/Week | Monthly Cost |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Daily engagement (comments) | 5 hours | $0 |
| Weekly post creation | 2 hours | $0 |
| DM follow-ups | 1 hour | $0 |
| **Total** | **8 hours/week** | **$0** |

**ROI Estimate:**
- 40 leads/month × 10% booking rate = 4 consultations
- 4 consultations × 25% close rate = 1 client
- 1 client × $1,500 average = $1,500/month revenue
- **ROI: ∞ (time investment only)**

---

### Paid Reddit Ads (Budget)

| Activity | Daily Spend | Monthly Cost |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Subreddit ads | $10-20 | $300-600 |
| A/B testing | $5 | $150 |
| **Total** | **$15-25/day** | **$450-750** |

**ROI Estimate:**
- 100 clicks/day × 30 days = 3,000 clicks
- 3,000 clicks × 40% opt-in = 1,200 emails
- 1,200 emails × 10% booking rate = 120 consultations
- 120 consultations × 25% close = 30 clients
- 30 clients × $1,500 = $45,000 revenue
- **ROI: 60-100x**

---

## Conclusion

Reddit is a **long-game strategy** for your validation subdomain. Unlike paid ads that deliver instant results, Reddit requires:

1. **Consistent participation** (daily engagement)
2. **Genuine value-first approach** (no overt sales)
3. **Patience** (reputation takes weeks to build)

**But the payoff is huge:**
- ✅ Free, high-quality leads (founders actively seeking help)
- ✅ Builds your personal brand as an expert
- ✅ Creates evergreen content (posts stay searchable forever)
- ✅ Community endorsement (social proof from peers)

**Start small:**
- Week 1-2: Engage, don't post
- Week 3: First value post (landing page reviews)
- Week 4: Share lessons learned post
- Month 2: Layer in paid ads

**Key mindset shift:**
- ❌ "How can I sell my service on Reddit?"
- ✅ "How can I help founders while building my reputation?"

The leads will come naturally when you're genuinely helpful.

---

**Next Steps:**
1. [ ] Review this strategy and pick 3 subreddits to start with
2. [ ] Create your first "I'll review 5 landing pages" post draft
3. [ ] Set up F5Bot alerts for "landing page feedback"
4. [ ] Block 30 min/day in calendar for Reddit engagement

**Good luck! 🚀**

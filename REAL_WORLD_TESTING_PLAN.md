# Real-World Testing Plan

**Date**: November 13, 2025  
**Phase**: Integration & Optimization - Phase 2  
**Status**: In Progress  

---

## 🎯 **Testing Approach**

We'll test 3 real-world workflows that represent typical usage:

1. **Morning Investment Check** (5 minutes) - Most frequent use case
2. **Development Workflow** (10 minutes) - Continuous validation
3. **Monthly Portfolio Review** (15 minutes) - Comprehensive analysis

Each workflow will be executed end-to-end, validating:
- ✅ Tools work as expected
- ✅ Output is useful and actionable
- ✅ Performance is acceptable
- ✅ Integration is seamless
